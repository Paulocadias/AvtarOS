Project Scope & Deliverables: AvatarOSProject Name: AvatarOS Biometric Capture ToolVersion: 1.0.0Repository: https://github.com/Paulocadias/AvtarOS.git1. Executive SummaryAvatarOS is a browser-based Single Page Application (SPA) designed to democratize the creation of high-fidelity 3D avatars. It replaces expensive hardware scanners with a standard webcam and a guided user interface. The tool facilitates the acquisition of facial texture maps (photos) and volumetric depth data (video sequences) through a "gamified" user experience that ensures optimal head positioning and lighting.2. Project ObjectivesHardware Agnostic: Function on any modern device with a webcam (Laptop, Tablet, Desktop).High Usability: Guide non-technical users through a complex photogrammetry process using simple visual cues.Visual Fidelity: Provide a "High-Tech/Professional" aesthetic (HUD) to instill confidence in the biometric process.Robust Error Handling: Gracefully handle lack of camera permissions or hardware absence.3. In-Scope Features (Functional Requirements)3.1. Core Biometric CaptureReal-Time Camera Feed: Direct integration with navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia to stream video to a canvas.Texture Map Acquisition (Step 1):Static image capture logic."Flash" animation feedback.Oval alignment overlay to enforce head scale.Volumetric Scan (Step 2):Video recording simulation timer.Auto-Detection Logic: System waits for camera initialization before starting the scan.Guided Movement Sequence: Automated prompts instructing the user to look Center, Left, Right, Up, and Down.Dynamic progress ring visualizing the scan duration.3.2. User Interface (UI) & Experience (UX)Heads-Up Display (HUD):Corner reticles and scanning grids.Glassmorphism effects (blurred backgrounds).Real-time status updates (e.g., "Initializing Sensors," "Face Locked").Visual Feedback:Step Indicator: Progress bar showing current stage (Intro -> Photo -> Video -> Processing -> Success).Interactive Icons: Lucide-React icons that pulse or change color based on state (Scanning vs. Recording).Theme Engine:Dark Mode (Default): "Cyberpunk/Industrial" aesthetic using deep blacks (bg-black) and amber accents (text-yellow-500).Light Mode: "Clinical/Laboratory" aesthetic using clean whites and sharp grays.One-click toggle persistence.3.3. Processing SimulationValidation Loader: A visual sequence simulating the backend processing steps:Uploading High-Res Textures.Processing Point Cloud.Mapping Facial Topology.Calculating Depth Vectors.Rendering 3D Mesh.Success Dashboard: Final screen displaying hypothetical stats (Poly Count: 2.4M, Texture: 8K RAW) to confirm successful "generation."3.4. Technical FallbacksNo-Camera State: If the webcam is unavailable or denied, the app renders a fallback "Grid" visualization to allow the UI flow to be tested/demonstrated without hardware.4. Out of Scope (Exclusions)Backend Processing: This project covers the Frontend Capture Tool only. Actual generation of .obj or .glb files requires a Python/C++ backend (e.g., AliceVision or NeRF) which is not included in this React codebase.User Authentication: No login/signup database integration.Cloud Storage: Captured photos/videos are currently processed in browser memory and not uploaded to an AWS S3 or Firebase bucket.Mobile Native App: This is a Web Application, not a Swift/Kotlin native app (though it is responsive).5. Technical StackFrontend Framework: React 18Build Tool: Vite (for fast HMR and optimized bundling)Styling: Tailwind CSS (Utility-first CSS)Icons: Lucide ReactHardware API: HTML5 MediaDevices API6. DeliverablesUpon completion, the following artifacts are delivered:IDDeliverable ItemDescriptionD1Source CodeComplete Git repository containing all .jsx, .css, and config files.D2Runnable BuildA production-ready dist/ folder generated via npm run build, ready for deployment to Vercel/Netlify.D3Project DocumentationA README.md file detailing installation, usage, and contribution guidelines.D4UI AssetsAll necessary icon sets and CSS configurations for the Yellow/Black identity system.7. Acceptance CriteriaApp loads successfully on localhost without console errors.Camera permission prompt appears immediately upon clicking "Initialize Capture".Video feed is mirrored (standard mirror behavior for selfies).Theme toggle switches instantly between Dark (Black/Yellow) and Light (White/Gray) modes.Completing the flow results in the "Twin Generated" success screen.
